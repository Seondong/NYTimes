\par\par \uc2 Views\par \b \uc2 EDITORIAL:  \highlight22\uc2 Seoul \highlight\uc2  should end impudent case against Japanese journalist\b0\par\par\uc2 628 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 December 2015\par \uc2 AJW (Asia & Japan Watch)\par \uc2 ASAHIE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015. The Asahi Shimbun Company.   \par \par \uc2 A South Korean court on Dec. 17 acquitted Tatsuya Kato, a former \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2  bureau chief for the Sankei Shimbun, who was indicted on a charge of defaming South Korean President Park Geun-hye.\par \par \uc2 The ruling was all too appropriate considering that South Korean law guarantees freedom of speech.\par \par \uc2 It was extraordinary in the first place for prosecutors, who exercise public authority, to indict a journalist just for writing an article that displeased the president.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2  Central District Court handed down a totally reasonable ruling by saying, \u8220\'20\'1CIt is clear that freedom of speech should be respected because our nation has adopted a democratic system.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors should swiftly accept the court decision without appealing it.\par \par \uc2 The case concerned an article written by Kato that ran on the Sankei website in August 2014. It referred to a \u8220\'20\'1Crumor\u8221\'20\'1D that Park was with a former male aide and could not be reached for seven hours on April 16, 2014, the day of the Sewol ferry disaster.\par \par \uc2 The presidential office reacted angrily to the article, pledging to \u8220\'20\'1Cpursue the responsibility.\u8221\'20\'1D Prosecutors then started an investigation into the defamation allegations in response to a criminal complaint filed by a citizen organization and indicted Kato. He was long banned from leaving the country.\par \par \uc2 Under South Korean law, Kato would not have been indicted if President Park, the alleged victim of defamation, had said she didn\u8217\'20\'19t wish for punishment against the Sankei journalist.\par \par \uc2 But the fact is that the trial following the indictment lasted for as long as 14 months, leading to the Dec. 17 ruling. That leaves little doubt that Park herself wanted to see the journalist prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 Didn\u8217\'20\'19t she give any thought to how badly \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s democracy would be damaged by the prosecution of a reporter for a news organization just because of the wishes of the person in power?\par \par \uc2 Unsurprisingly, journalist organizations of not only Japan but also other countries voiced strong concerns about the South Korean government\u8217\'20\'19s legal action against Kato.\par \par \uc2 Before the verdict was read out, the presiding judge revealed that the \uc2 South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs\uc2  had asked the court to give consideration to Japan\u8217\'20\'19s request for \u8220\'20\'1Cappropriate handling\u8221\'20\'1D of the case.\par \par \uc2 It was an unusual move that can be interpreted as an attempt by the South Korean government to end the case, which has further strained bilateral relations and provoked international criticism.\par \par \uc2 The Park administration should do serious soul-searching on its misguided move to prosecute a case that should never have been brought to court in the first place. By doing so, \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2  unnecessarily created a sticky political issue with serious diplomatic consequences.\par \par \uc2 Even without the case, relations between the Japanese and South Korean governments have soured badly in the past few years, casting dark shadows even on grass-roots exchanges between people of the two neighboring countries.\par \par \uc2 Both Tokyo and \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2  should restrain themselves from any action that could generate unnecessary diplomatic friction.\par \par \uc2 The court ruling, however, acknowledged that the former Sankei bureau chief was aware that the rumor he wrote about was false.\par \par \uc2 The defense team stopped denying this allegation during the trial. This means the Sankei cannot claim to have fulfilled its responsibility as a news medium.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s legal action against the Sankei reporter has been a festering sore in the relationship between the country and Japan.\par \par \uc2 This case should be brought to an end quickly so that the two governments can concentrate on diplomatic efforts to resolve really important issues, like the \u8220\'20\'1Ccomfort women.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 --The Asahi Shimbun, Dec. 18\par \par \uc2 Tatsuya Kato, a former \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2  bureau chief for the Sankei Shimbun, arrives at a court in \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2  on Oct. 19.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One of the Harper government's wishes is at last coming true, now that it is no longer in a position to boast about its fostering of greater competition in the Canadian wireless phone industry.\par \par \uc2 Shaw Communications Inc\uc2 . is buying \uc2 Wind Mobile Corp\uc2 ., subject of course to regulatory approval. That means there will be four national wireless carriers after all, backed by four big national telecom conglomerates, instead of just three. It's not an enormous difference, but more choice is better than less.\par \par \uc2 The three major incumbents are \uc2 Telus Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 BCE Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Rogers Communications Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Conservative government had set up convoluted auctions of new spectrum, explicitly skewed in order to favour a new, national carrier. The established carriers campaigned vigorously to be allowed to bid for the added spectrum without being hobbled, but to no avail.\par \par \uc2 But none of the would-be up-and-coming candidates for the hoped-for fourth carrier were able to take advantage of the preference offered by the government.\par \par \uc2 Mobilicity\uc2 , for one, went into creditor protection, and later was acquired by Rogers. For a time, the outspoken Egyptian tycoon \uc2 Naguib Sawiris\uc2  invested in the Canadian telecom industry, including \uc2 Wind Mobile\uc2 , but he was frustrated by undisclosed national security concerns on the part of the \uc2 Canadian government\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 he speculated it might have had to do with his former interest in a mobile licence in North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In any case, Mr. Sawiris swore that he would never invest in Canada again.\par \par \uc2 Wind Mobile Corp\uc2 . struggled on. The Dutch telecom company \uc2 VimpelCom\uc2  took an interest, but two years ago it withdrew. And in any case, the government was unwilling to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of a major Canadian telecom.\par \par \uc2 Canada can handle at least four wireless carriers. Unfortunately, the move from three to four has come about without the country opening the door wide to new foreign competitors. Instead, the field has been restricted to reassuringly home-grown entities such as Shaw, a long-standing player in other parts of the communications and media business. Even so, the Canadian wireless market just got a little more competitive, thanks to the legacy of \uc2 Stephen Harper\uc2  and James Moore. Canadian consumers will be the winners.\par \par \uc2 Document GLOB000020151218ebci0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw119\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1785\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican candidates for president want to convince voters they could keep America safer from terrorism than the Democrats. The reality is their reckless rhetoric and ridiculous proposals in Tuesday night's debate would make the world a more dangerous place, isolate the United States and fuel the very radicalism that threatens the nation. Their irresponsible attempts to appear tougher than each other did not project the thoughtful approach to national security demanded of a U.S. president dealing with unstable situations around the world.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , the leader in the national Republican primary polls, still wants to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States and alienate law-abiding Muslims who are needed to help fight the terrorists. For good measure, Trump also threw in shutting down the Internet, or at least part of the Internet, to prevent the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  from using it as a recruiting tool. That reflects a lack of understanding in how the Internet works and would put the United States in good company with North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  in trying to control the digital world.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who leads Iowa in some polls, defended his call to "carpet-bomb ISIS into oblivion'' and brushed aside obliterating entire cities and killing thousands of innocents in the process. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie would shoot down Russian planes to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria, which Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky correctly suggested could trigger World War III. Any hint of relying on diplomacy, or enlisting help from adversaries such as Iran and Russia to fight ISIS and calm the Middle East, was lost in this noisy, scary call for war. Nuance, calm, consensus-building and concern for unintended consequences are largely lost in this crowd.\par \par \uc2 So is any appreciation for the facts. Trump claimed "people are pouring across the southern border" of the United States when illegal immigration from Mexico has sharply dropped. \uc2 Carly Fiorina\uc2  said she would bring back a "warrior class'' such as \uc2 Gen. David Petraeus\uc2  and suggested they were forced out because they stood up to President Barack Obama. Petraeus resigned as CIA director after investigators found he had an affair with his biographer and gave her classified materials. \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  recounted how the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2 's metadata collection of phone records worked and overstated its usefulness. Cruz incorrectly described the impact of the new USA Freedom Act that still allows the government to get access to those phone records with a court order.\par \par \uc2 The contours of the race less than two months before the Iowa caucuses came into sharper focus. Former Gov. Jeb Bush had his best night, from his more sophisticated approach on fighting terrorism to his successful one-liners aimed at Trump ("Donald, you are not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency."). Trump finally lost his swagger for a bit, complaining that the moderators made sure the attacks were aimed at him. That happens to frontrunners, but Bush trails far behind in the polls and needs to make up ground fast. In another mini-drama, Rubio and Cruz sparred over the NSA's data collection and immigration as they each tried to separate themselves from the pack to become the clearest alternative to Trump.\par \par \uc2 Americans are understandably on edge about terrorism in the wake of the massacres in Paris and California. But stoking those fears and promising bold action that lacks any appreciation for the consequences is not a responsible way forward. As the number of Republicans in the race for president drops, the seriousness of their approaches to keeping the nation safe can only go up.\par \par \uc2 Document STPT000020151217ebch0006m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw151\pich50\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2265\pichgoal750

\par\par \uc2 Opinion\par \b \uc2 The risky nuclear deal with India\b0\par\par\uc2 919 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 December 2015\par \uc2 The Japan Times\par \uc2 JTIM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9  Copyright 2015 The Japan Times. All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 During his visit to New Delhi last week, Prime Minister \uc2 Shinzo Abe\uc2  and his Indian counterpart \uc2 Narendra Modi\uc2  agreed in principle on a civil nuclear cooperation pact that would pave the way for export of Japan's nuclear power plant technology to India. It will be Japan's first such deal with a country that has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In working out its further details, the government needs to ensure a clear mechanism to prevent India from using the technology provided by Japan to enhance its nuclear weapons capabilities. This is Japan's duty as the only country in history to suffer nuclear attacks.\par \par \uc2 Japan has so far refrained from signing a civil nuclear cooperation pact with countries that are outside the NPT regime. Such an agreement with India, a de facto nuclear weapons power, is tantamount to Tokyo accepting possession of nuclear weapons by a country that is not a party to the NPT, representing a major shift in Japan's nuclear policy. It may compromise Japan's position of calling on North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which has withdrawn from the NPT regime, to end its nuclear weapons program. The pact would have the effect of further reduce India's incentive to join the NPT regime. One wonders whether the Abe administration has seriously considered these effects.\par \par \uc2 The root of Japan's talks with India for a civil nuclear pact goes back to a proposal made in the late 2000s by U.S. President George W. Bush to change the rules of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a multinational body designed to control the export of nuclear apparatuses and technology to ensure nuclear nonproliferation. Behind the proposal was the Bush administration's desire to strengthen the United States' strategic ties with India. Although the NSG, whose members include the U.S., Russia, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Japan, had prohibited civil nuclear cooperation with India because of its nuclear explosion test in 1974, the group in 2008 granted a waiver to India from its rules. Japan was initially cautious about the change but eventually succumbed to pressure from the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The change prompted the U.S., France, Russia, \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  and others to sign agreements with India on nuclear cooperation. Abe's move represents the desire of Japan's nuclear power industry, whose prospect in the domestic market is uncertain following the 2011 Fukushima crisis, to enter the growing market of nuclear power in India. Currently, 21 nuclear power plants are in operation in the country, and there are plans to build over 30 more to meet the demand of its expanding population.\par \par \uc2 Abe says his agreement with Modi ensures that Japan' nuclear technology provided to India would be used solely for peaceful purposes. A government official said Japan would halt the implementation of the pact if India tests a nuclear weapon, which it has not done since 1998. That would be a logical course of action for Japan.\par \par \uc2 A major problem with the planned pact is that Japan would allow India to reprocess nuclear fuel burned in a plant built with Japanese components and materials. Plutonium extracted through reprocessing of spent fuel can be converted into nuclear weapons. To prevent that, the pact needs to have a mechanism to verify the volume of such plutonium and its whereabouts. Still, the more plutonium India can secure for commercial purposes, the more it can possibly concentrate on using uranium produced in the country for military purposes. India and Pakistan, which also possesses nuclear weapons, are in confrontation for many years. Utmost efforts must be made to stop India from reinforcing its nuclear arsenal by taking advantage of this pact.\par \par \uc2 During the talks with Abe, Modi also agreed to introduce Japan's shinkansen technology to build a high-speed railway linking Mumbai and Ahmedabad in western India. India hopes the project worth \u165\'00\'A51.8 trillion \u8212\'20\'14 for which Tokyo has agreed to extend \u165\'00\'A51.46 trillion in loans \u8212\'20\'14 will begin in 2017 and be put to service in 2023. Although Japan succeeded in exporting its bullet-train technology to Taiwan in the late 1990s, it lost out to China in October in the competition to sell the technology to Indonesia. India appears to have put priority on the safety and technological advantage of the shinkansen system. Japan should support India in the training of personnel, including operation controllers, drivers and maintenance workers, in addition to the export of hardware.\par \par \uc2 Abe's latest visit to and deals with India are part of his administration's efforts to check the rising influence of China by deepening Tokyo's ties with New Delhi. The two leaders agreed that the Maritime Self-Defense Force will become a permanent participant in India and the U.S.' annual joint naval drill known as Exercise Malabar, which is carried out with China's rise as a regional maritime power in mind. Japan and India also signed deals paving the way for transfer of Japanese defense equipment and technology and exchanges of defense-related information.\par \par \uc2 While Japan and India are both wary of China's growing maritime presence in the region, New Delhi is more flexible in its approach toward Beijing. For example, India is a founding member of the China-led \uc2 Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank\uc2 , from which Japan, along with the U.S., has opted out. Abe should realize that building friendly ties with both China and India in a balanced manner will contribute to enhancing Japan's interests.\par \par \uc2 Document JTIM000020151216ebch00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw215\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3225\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Dec. 11\par \par \uc2 The Oakland Tribune on the state's financial climate:\par \par \uc2 With state finances improving, it's time to pay down debts while there's money available.\par \par \uc2 In early January, Gov. Jerry Brown will present his budget proposal for fiscal year 2016-17. In anticipation, Legislative Analyst Mac Taylor last month reported that the state is better prepared for an economic downturn than at any point in decades.\par \par \uc2 Taylor forecasts that, if the economy stays strong, the state's rainy day fund will grow from $5.6 billion this year to $11.2 billion in 2019-20. The governor wisely championed this emergency fund and convinced voters in 2014 to require it.\par \par \uc2 In addition, discretionary reserves that lawmakers can tap will increase from $2 billion this year to $17 billion in 2019-20. That strong forecast takes into account the phase-out, starting next year, of the temporary sales and income tax hikes voters approved in 2012.\par \par \uc2 In other words, the fiscal crisis that precipitated Brown's plea for tax increases is over. The push by some politicians and labor groups for a voter extension next year is misguided.\par \par \uc2 That said, while the crisis has passed, a huge debt hangover remains. This is not the time to add lots of new programs that will make it harder to balance the budget during the next economic downturn. Yes, there will be another downturn.\par \par \uc2 As the governor's finance director, Michael Cohen, warned, "we must continue to pursue fiscal discipline, pay down liabilities, and build up our Rainy Day Fund during these fleeting good times."\par \par \uc2 About those liabilities he mentioned: The state currently owes more than $210 billion for unfunded pension and retiree health care obligations for state workers, school teachers and University of California employees.\par \par \uc2 That's how much the investment funds are currently short. Over the past four years, the governor developed plans for addressing the imbalances. But the repayments are stretched out, in most cases, for three decades.\par \par \uc2 That's too long and the governor knows it. For example, last month, he sharply criticized the \uc2 California Public Employees Retirement System\uc2  for using what he correctly termed "irresponsible" investment assumptions that tamp down payments.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 CalPERS\uc2  had acted responsibly, the state would have been required to make higher minimum contributions. However, the pension system's failure doesn't preclude the governor and Legislature from doing the smart thing by paying more now.\par \par \uc2 Just like a credit card bill, larger payments now, when money is available, will reduce future payments when times are tight. They guard against severe future budget cuts.\par \par \uc2 The same principle applies to all the retirement debts. As the governor prepares his budget, he should insist that the state more aggressively pay them down.\par \par \uc2 Brown restored the state's fiscal stability. Now he should protect it.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Dec. 15\par \par \uc2 San Francisco Chronicle on drought legislation :\par \par \uc2 Yet another attempt to assist drought-stricken California with federal funding resulted in a partisan dustup last week rather than a bipartisan plan. The state needs federal funding and scientific expertise to help develop water management programs that will carry us through this drought and the many more that will come. Instead, the first drops of rain provided new water to fight over.\par \par \uc2 After months of closed-door talks with \uc2 Sen. Dianne Feinstein\uc2 , D-Calif., and House Democrats, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, introduced draft language he characterized as bipartisan as a potential addition to the omnibus budget bill. The rider included $21 million for actions to benefit fish, $100 million for desalination projects, and $200 million for water recycling or reuse projects. It also had $600 million for water storage, both dams and groundwater projects.\par \par \uc2 Both Feinstein and fellow California Democrat Sen. Barbara Boxer immediately lambasted the release of un-vetted language. "There were at least a half-dozen items in the bill that I had rejected and that would have drawn objections from state or federal agencies \u8212\'20\'14 some of them would likely violate environmental law," Feinstein said in a statement. She said she plans to bring a stand-alone bill to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in coming days.\par \par \uc2 McCarthy's office defended the action, saying it is unlikely any Democratic bill would make it through the Republican-controlled Senate, thus the need to introduce the language now. "Legislation is needed before the end of the year so the state can capture and take advantage of El Ni\u241\'00\'F1o before the water runs to the ocean," said Matt Sparks, McCarthy's press secretary.\par \par \uc2 McCarthy has that partially right. The state needs federal assistance to deal with the worst drought in its history, one that has required water rationing and left some coastal and valley communities without water. Congress does need to move quickly to manage whatever water El Ni\u241\'00\'F1o-spawned storms produce.\par \par \uc2 We don't need a federal law that would send more water south to Central Valley agribusiness, as this one would. We do need programs, modeled on state efforts to increase water recycling and water efficiency, that benefit all Californians.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Dec. 12\par \par \uc2 Ventura County Star on Gov. Brown's efforts to fight climate change:\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jerry Brown left Paris last week before it was known whether the intense negotiations for a global climate change agreement would be successful. It didn't matter because Gov. Brown had already achieved a major level of success outside the talks about nation leaders.\par \par \uc2 The governor has made the fight against climate change his ultimate final act on the political stage and it appears that he is winning in the initial rounds.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Brown won the attention of the global press as he bounced around the Paris salons preaching his mantra of greenhouse gas reduction. Time magazine described him as the "talk of the town."\par \par \uc2 That's because, beyond his intense philosophical discourses, the governor was able to raise the visibility of his plan for having the smaller governments of the world step up to achieve the kind of climate control solutions that the national governments seem unable to reach.\par \par \uc2 It's called the Under 2 MOU group, a decidedly bureaucratic and unsexy name. Basically it's open to any state or city around the world that is willing to commit to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 80 to 95 percent, or limit to two metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita, by 2050.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Brown and his environmental team started the idea in a pact with the German state Baden-Wurttemberg. It now has 65 signatories around the world and the exposure at the Paris conference should drive the number higher.\par \par \uc2 Basically the group believes that they can accomplish at their level what national governments faced with bigger political infighting are unable to achieve. The mayor of \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 , told Time, "Local governments are actually leading national governments. They are the driving force. In the new climate regime, this will continue."\par \par \uc2 In that effort, Gov. Brown is their leader, their rock star. The three-time presidential candidate loves the job. He brings more than stardom to the role.\par \par \uc2 He can point to California's environmental accomplishments to show that ideas can be turned into policy that then can be implemented. For instance, one of the hot topics in Paris was cap-and-trade, a 30-year-old concept that is gaining new attention. Gov. Brown can point to California's system of an emissions trading market as a solution in practice.\par \par \uc2 There are many others, many pushed through the California Legislature by Sen. Fran Pavley, the Agoura Hills Democrat who has represented Ventura County since 2000 and also joined the California delegation in Paris. Her signature laws capping greenhouse gas emissions continue to put California in front of the world in its effort to clean the air.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Brown gave his conservative friends back home plenty of campaign fodder while in Paris with his explanation in one session that to achieve environmental success, you need policy that leads to laws and regulations. "Never underestimate the coercive power of the central state in the service of good," he said. It's a wonderfully inflammatory poster quote that also should not surprise anyone who has followed the governor during his long political career.\par \par \uc2 In the end, he believes that he and California can continue to be leaders in this battle to help our planet survive. We continue to support his effort and applaud his willingness to step onto the global stage with these ideas to help convince the world there is a better way.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Dec. 15\par \par \uc2 Pasadena Star News on the threatening email that caused the closure of Los Angeles schools:\par \par \uc2 No doubt, San Bernardino was fresh on Los Angeles schools Superintendent Ramon Cortines' mind when he decided to cancel classes today after a threatening email turned up in the school district's inbox.\par \par \uc2 Less than two weeks after a radicalized couple believed to have been influenced by the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  went on a shooting rampage in San Bernardino, killing 14 and wounding 22 others, Cortines had to consider the possibility that those behind the email might follow through on the threat to L.A. schools.\par \par \uc2 We now know the threatening email sent to the district was, thankfully, a hoax. But early this morning, Cortines had to make a call based on the information he had at the time, and closed Los Angeles Unified School District campuses for the day.\par \par \uc2 He made clear in media briefings that his decision came down to one thing: He would not take any chances.\par \par \uc2 Even if there were no bombs in lockers, as the email threatened, Cortines couldn't gamble with students' lives. He took all necessary precautions.\par \par \uc2 And so, images of empty LAUSD campuses and worried parents reached a national audience with a collective anxiety that has reached new heights in past weeks.\par \par \uc2 After a work holiday party turned deadly in San Bernardino, Southern Californians especially are still on edge, many worried that their most mundane routines could turn into their worst nightmares.\par \par \uc2 This is new territory for everyone, and LAUSD's sending home more than half a million children sends a chill throughout the region, reminding us all of our schools' vulnerability.\par \par \uc2 But now it's time to separate fear from facts.\par \par \uc2 Congressman Brad Sherman and others cast doubt on the credibility of the LAUSD threat before it was revealed to be a hoax, and \uc2 Bill Bratton\uc2 , the New York police commissioner, criticized L.A. officials for "overreacting" to the email. New York schools received a similar threat today.\par \par \uc2 There are fair questions to ask about how L.A. officials determine what constitutes a credible threat on schools and in our communities, and we expect they will be answered in due time.\par \par \uc2 Equally important is the need to continue the fight against giving ourselves over to fear in the wake of San Bernardino. Knee-jerk reactions to the tragedy, such as calls to ban all Muslims from coming into the United States, go too far and ultimately do more harm in our communities than good.\par \par \uc2 Cortines, faced with a very specific choice, did his best.\par \par \uc2 There are times when a decision must be made in a moment, even with incomplete information. That's the space where Cortines found himself.\par \par \uc2 If there is one good thing that came from the abrupt closure of so many schools, it was the positive response so many in our communities showed in the face of uncertainty. Parents picked up neighbors' children, restaurants offered free lunches and temporary care centers were set up. People took care of each other.\par \par \uc2 This is likely not the last threat the region will face, nor the last crisis, in our new reality after San Bernardino. We need to be smart in our response to threats and to continue to take care of each other.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Dec. 15\par \par \uc2 Contra Costa Times on gambling laws:\par \par \uc2 Gambling laws in California can be as hard to follow as the dice bouncing around a craps table. It's anybody's guess which game might be legal or illegal next.\par \par \uc2 Betting on horse races is permitted, but betting on other sports is prohibited. You can play the state lottery, but you can't hold a bingo game \u8212\'20\'14 unless it's a charity event. Card games are OK if, as in poker, the competition is among players, but not if, as in blackjack, it's players vs. the house. (More complication: Online poker is banned.)\par \par \uc2 Piled on top of all that, there are the exploding number of Native American-owned casinos where the rules are different yet again.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers and voters show selective judgment when it comes to gambling and associated social and moral issues, usually basing their decisions on political and economic goals.\par \par \uc2 So it's uncertain how elected officials will come down on the latest gaming issue. But it's clear what they should do.\par \par \uc2 The issue concerns fantasy sports, the game in which fans win or lose money based on the performances of individual athletes in team sports instead of betting on entire teams.\par \par \uc2 Sports television is full of ads for \uc2 FanDuel\uc2  and \uc2 DraftKings\uc2 , companies that run daily online versions of the games. The ads imply daily games are a road to riches for anyone with a little sports knowledge; in truth the vast majority of players lose money.\par \par \uc2 The promoters of this billion-dollar industry make the dubious claim that their games are not gambling because they involve skill as well as luck.\par \par \uc2 Oh, stop it. These enterprises are gambling, pure and simple.\par \par \uc2 New York and Nevada have determined this is illegal gambling under those states' laws. Now come efforts in California to either halt operations here (as Assemblyman Marc Levine has asked Attorney General Kamala Harris to do) or license, regulate and tax the companies (under a bill by Assemblyman Adam Gray).\par \par \uc2 Both assemblymen say they're acting in the name of consumer protection, and given charges that a \uc2 DraftKings\uc2  employee profited from a sort of insider trading, that's a good part of the reason for state officials to act. It offered a practical look at why this industry needs some closer scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 But it may be simpler than just scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Daily fantasy sports clearly have the most in common with traditional sports betting or online poker. Neither of those is legal here, despite years of legislative pushes.\par \par \uc2 Allowing their young cousin to be legal will only further complicate the state gambling regulations. The Legislature should outlaw these daily fantasy sports games.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020151216ebcg00b1o\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 EDITORIAL: Cooperation on building N-plants a pillar of Japan-India strategic ties\b0\par\par\uc2 By Editorial Desk in Tokyo/The Japan News/16 December 2015\par \uc2 636 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 December 2015\par 12:56\par \uc2 ANN Asia News Network\par \uc2 ANNT\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015. ANN   \par \par \uc2 Tokyo (The Japan News/ANN) - Japan and India are major powers that share strategic interests. Both countries must steadily deepen their multidimensional cooperation.\par \par \uc2 Prime Minister \uc2 Shinzo Abe\uc2  visited India and held talks with his Indian counterpart, \uc2 Narendra Modi\uc2 , signing a joint statement in which both countries pledged to cooperate in such areas as nuclear power plants, high-speed railways and security.\par \par \uc2 Following the talks, Abe emphasised, \u191\'00\'BFJapan and India are entering a new era." Modi said: \u191\'00\'BFJapanese companies\u191\'00\'BF investment in India will dramatically increase."\par \par \uc2 Worthy of note is that the two countries agreed, in principle, on nuclear cooperation, which would allow Japanese firms to export to India equipment and technology related to nuclear power plants. India has already concluded a nuclear cooperation accord with other countries, including the United States, France, Russia and \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To solve its acute power shortage, India plans to drastically increase the number of its nuclear power plants. Japan\u191\'00\'BFs cooperation will be in sync with India\u191\'00\'BFs energy strategy and will form a key foundation for raising the Japan-India bilateral relationship to a higher dimension.\par \par \uc2 India is a nuclear power which has not yet signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In 2008, the country made clear internationally that it would continue a freeze on nuclear tests.\par \par \uc2 During summit talks, Abe told Modi that Japan would suspend nuclear cooperation if India holds a nuclear test. The accord should limit the cooperation to solely peaceful purposes, while a clear-cut brake should be put in place to prevent the fruits of the cooperation from being applied militarily.\par \par \uc2 It is important for the Japan to persistently urge India to join an international framework of nuclear nonproliferation and to promote nuclear disarmament.\par \par \uc2 Shinkansen\u191\'00\'BFs next stop\par \par \uc2 Both leaders also agreed to have the Shinkansen bullet train system adopted for India\u191\'00\'BFs high-speed rail project, currently being planned, connecting the cities of Mumbai and Ahmedabad in western India. The project\u191\'00\'BFs cost is estimated to total 1.8 trillion yen (US$14.85 billion), with Japan offering yen loans to cover up to about 80 per cent of the total.\par \par \uc2 It will be the second case for Japan\u191\'00\'BFs Shinkansen bullet train system to be adopted abroad, following Taiwan.\par \par \uc2 In light of the fact that Japan lost to China in a bid to win a contract to build Indonesia\u191\'00\'BFs high-speed railway, Japan boosted its provision of financial assistance. The latest success in winning the contract is likely due to this.\par \par \uc2 Expansion in exports of nuclear power and transportation infrastructure is a major pillar of the growth strategy pursued by the Abe administration. The public and private sectors should cooperate with each other closely from a medium- and long-term perspective.\par \par \uc2 Regarding developments in the South China Sea, both leaders, in the joint statement, called on countries concerned to avoid \u191\'00\'BFunilateral actions." They had in mind China, the country that has been building artificial islands there.\par \par \uc2 Securing safety of the sea-lanes linking the Middle East and Asia is essential for free economic activity. It is necessary to raise objections and make requests to Beijing, taking advantage of various opportunities, concerning China\u191\'00\'BFs strong-arm maritime advances.\par \par \uc2 Japan and India signed an accord regarding the transfer of defense equipment and technology and a pact on protection of military information.\par \par \uc2 The two countries also agreed that the Maritime Self-Defense Force will regularly take part in US-India naval exercises.\par \par \uc2 In order to enhance the effectiveness of defense cooperation between Japan and India, a multitiered partnership that includes such countries as the United States and Australia should be reinforced.\par \par \uc2 (From The Yomiuri Shimbun, Dec 15, 2015)\par \par \uc2 COPYRIGHT: \uc2 ASIA NEWS NETWORK\par \par \uc2 Document ANNT000020151216ebcg00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw312\pich35\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4680\pichgoal525

The idea would be to cast a worldwide American military net to mount Special Operations missions and gather intelligence on terrorists wherever they exist.\par \par \uc2 The new bases, to be established in Burkina Faso (which just reversed an attempted military takeover), Cameroon, Ethiopia, Niger, Spain and Iraqi Kurdistan, would each include forces from 500 to 5,000. According to Pentagon officials, the new "hubs" wouldn't cost much, although money for "base improvements" would be part of the tab. What that means is, start small, build a 7,500- foot runway, add aircraft, add a drone base, build quarters to house troops and proceed from there.\par \par \uc2 The ambitious Pentagon proposal has been sent to President Barack Obama and awaits his approval.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, it is consistent with a view of the world that says the world's conflicts should be addressed by the United States, not regional or national bodies. That approach is inconsistent not only with America's financial predicament, but also the lack of logic in the United States taking on everything everywhere.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama should kill this proposal for military expansion and force the Pentagon to accept the budget cuts that the rest of the government is imposing on itself and to scale back its activities globally.\par \par \uc2 Document PPGZ000020151214ebce0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw223\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3345\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Emphasizing Science and Technology to Lift Liberia [editorial]\b0\par\par\uc2 737 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 December 2015\par 00:44\par \uc2 All Africa\par \uc2 AFNWS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Dec 14, 2015 (Liberian Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The faculty and students of the University of Liberia's T.J.R. Faulkner College of Science and Technology did themselves and the nation a great favor last week by inviting South Korean Ambassador Noh Kyu Duk to be their commencement speaker. Ambassador Noh explained to the graduates how his country became one of the Asian Tigers that lifted their people out of poverty and backwardness and made them industrious and rich.\par \par \uc2 For starters, let us tell our readers who the four Asian Tigers are. They are East Asian nations who, one time poor and backward, seriously embraced education, industry and technology and became four of the world's richest and most highly developed nations. They are Hong Kong, Singapore, \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Taiwan. There are two other facts our readers need to know about the four Asian Tigers: First, that they all, unlike Liberia and many other African nations, had no natural resources; and second, they were all transformed into success stories after 1960.\par \par \uc2 Now, what did South Korean Ambassador Noh tell the T.R.J. Faulkner graduates? Liberia, he told them, should give priority to education, especially science and technology, in order to lift itself out of poverty and backwardness, just as \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the other Asian Tigers did beginning in the early 1960s. \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 , he recalled, earlier depended largely on textile (clothing, fabric) production, whose prices soon drastically declined.\par \par \uc2 Following this economic setback, the government in 1962 developed a five-year plan and turned its attention to serious investment in education and technology, especially the chemical industry. First in this direction was the steel industry. "Despite skepticism about the feasibility of such a venture in \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Ambassador Noh told the graduates, "the government successfully integrated steel mill in the early 1970s. This," he said, "paved the way for other steel-related industries, such as shipbuilding, automobiles, machinery and construction." But the government soon found out that without the support of science and technology of its own, the national goal of industrialization and economic development would be nothing more than a sand castle, which would soon crumble. In 1973, therefore, the government established "the Daedeok Science Town (DST) as an engine of enhancing national competitiveness of high technology."\par \par \uc2 Ambassador Noh then admonished the graduates to forget entertainment and laziness and rather focus on a plan of action to achieve their goals.\par \par \uc2 For her part, the valedictorian of the class, Ms. Anita Tarplah, urged her fellow graduates, yea all UL students, to "civically engage, rather than focus on egotistic ideals, prestige and ambitions of splendor."\par \par \uc2 This highly intelligent and serious-minded student knew what she was talking about. How many times within the past several years has the UL, including the College of Science and Technology, not lost precious time because UL students engaged in violent demonstrations that kept the university closed for months.\par \par \uc2 T.R.J. Faulkner Dean, Dr. Euphemia Weeks, herself a neuroscientist, underscored this point when, in her Academic Report, she recalled how these uncivil disruptions affected the TRJ College, closing it down for six months at a time.\par \par \uc2 We pray that all UL students, and students throughout Liberia, would heed the admonition of their fellow student Anita Tarplah, and turn their focus seriously upon their studies, to move their schools and fellow students FORWARD.\par \par \uc2 We would like to close this editorial with two critical questions: First, what next for the TRJ Faulkner Class of 2015? Second, what next for the Liberian government? Will the University of Liberia help move its talented students, like Ms. Tarplah and her classmates, one step further by affording them further science and tech training and helping them begin the technological and industrial revolution in Liberia?\par \par \uc2 Will the Liberian government emulate, albeit belatedly, the example of \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 ? Remember that Ambassador Noh said it is "never too late" to start doing the right thing.\par \par \uc2 Yes, Liberia, Singapore and \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  were on the same economic plane in 1960, and Liberia had a serious advantage over them: many natural resources. Alas! We were left behind, and we are still woefully behind. But it is NOT TOO LATE!\par \par \uc2 We must, however, just as \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  did in the 1960s, focus seriously on education, especially science and technology that will pave the way to our agricultural, industrial and technological revolutions. \par \par \uc2 Document AFNWS00020151214ebce001h9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw267\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4005\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Views\par \b \uc2 EDITORIAL: Japan-India nuclear cooperation a slap in the face of NPT\b0\par\par\uc2 643 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 December 2015\par \uc2 AJW (Asia & Japan Watch)\par \uc2 ASAHIE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015. The Asahi Shimbun Company.   \par \par \uc2 The framework for preventing the spread of technology and materials for building nuclear weapons is becoming increasingly compromised.\par \par \uc2 Even Japan, which has suffered atomic bombings, has joined the ranks of the world\u8217\'20\'19s nations that are eager to pitch nuclear technology even to a country with nuclear weapons for the sake of commercial interests.\par \par \uc2 During a visit to India on Dec. 12, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, that the two countries will sign a deal on civil nuclear cooperation. The agreement would bolster the export of nuclear technology by Japanese enterprises.\par \par \uc2 India became in possession of nuclear weapons without joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Its relations with neighboring Pakistan, which also refused to join the NPT and armed itself with nuclear weapons, remain strained.\par \par \uc2 Providing nuclear technology to such a nation should be called an act of folly that makes light of the longstanding and persevering nuclear nonproliferation efforts of the global community and would further emasculate the nonproliferation regime.\par \par \uc2 Rising calls for the abolition of nuclear weapons in the years following World War II, when the world came under a threat of the potential use of nuclear weapons, were the driving force behind the NPT, which entered into force in 1970.\par \par \uc2 Nations of the world, including Japan, joined the treaty under its guiding principle, which obligates the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia to commit to nuclear disarmament in exchange for granting them the status of nuclear-weapon states. The NPT also allows the other countries to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.\par \par \uc2 Supplier nations made it a rule not to trade in nuclear technology with countries outside that framework. But the United States took the initiative in granting an exception to India in 2008. Since then, the United States, France, Russia, \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other nations have all signed nuclear agreements with India.\par \par \uc2 Those countries are looking at India as a promising market for pitching nuclear power plant technology. That is because India already hosts about 20 nuclear reactors and plans to build 40 more at a time when it is becoming increasingly difficult to build reactors in advanced nations.\par \par \uc2 The United States and other countries should realize that compromising the nuclear nonproliferation principles for the benefit of business opportunities would engender serious problems for the future.\par \par \uc2 Japan, among others, is a nation that should be taking the lead in creating a nuclear-free world. It not only knows about the tragic consequences of the use of nuclear weapons but also has experienced one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest nuclear plant disasters and continues to be plagued by the resulting radioactive contamination.\par \par \uc2 Japan is the country that should be applying the brakes on any moves toward nuclear proliferation.\par \par \uc2 The previous administration led by the Democratic Party of Japan, however, opened negotiations on the nuclear deal with India five years ago. Both the DPJ government and Abe\u8217\'20\'19s current administration cannot escape the charge of having forgotten the duty and responsibility of a nation that has suffered atomic bombings.\par \par \uc2 Abe told a news conference Dec. 12 that he would go along with India in pursuing a world free of nuclear weapons. But he has yet to provide a specific action to achieve that goal.\par \par \uc2 We are only left to wonder how we could explain to North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Iran, which are insisting on their own nuclear development programs, why we are dealing differently with India. We could lose our convincing power for dissuading other nations from following in their footsteps.\par \par \uc2 The threat of nuclear arms will only increase as long as Japan, the United States and other countries, which should be guardians of the nonproliferation regime, are using their own hands to undermine its foundation.\par \par \uc2 --The Asahi Shimbun, Dec. 13\par \par \uc2 Document ASAHIE0020151214ebce00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw97\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1455\pichgoal600

Global Times. All rights reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Scheduled performances by North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 's State Merited Chorus and Moranbong Band from Saturday in Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts have been canceled.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Xinhua News Agency\uc2  released a brief report Saturday saying the show cannot be staged due to "communication issues at the working level." In the meantime, it cited that "China attached high importance to the cultural exchanges with North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and was ready to continue to work with it to promote bilateral exchanges and cooperation in culture and all other areas." On the same day, the Moranbong performers were seen departing from Beijing Capital International Airport.\par \par \uc2 It is a bit odd that the performances, which were highly anticipated, have been called off.\par \par \uc2 There is varied speculation over the reason. Some argue that it is related to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's declaration over possessing an H-bomb, some say that organizers from both sides failed to reach an agreement over officials of which levels should be present at the show, while some claim it is due to the groups' internal problems.\par \par \uc2 However, as of Sunday night, except for \uc2 Xinhua\uc2 's brief report, Pyongyang had not made any statement. This is part of the two sides' attitude. The incident is obviously not positive for bilateral ties, yet its negative influence might not be as big as in certain people's imagination.\par \par \uc2 The foundation of the Beijing-Pyongyang relationship is solid, with its friendly bond still firm. Meanwhile, the divergences over the nuclear issue continue to exist, which means the two countries are in a state of adapting to and handling this "new normal."\par \par \uc2 Although the show was not successfully staged, neither of the two sides wants it to be hyped up.\par \par \uc2 It won't be easy for a breakthrough in bilateral relations, yet there won't be an easy "break-up" due to a specific incident either. This bilateral relationship is still North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2 's most tenacious as well as its friendliest with the outside world.\par \par \uc2 China adheres to the stance of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, while cherishing the friendly ties with Pyongyang as well. Given the strategic relationship between the two, the atmosphere surrounding the show might have a short-term impact, but will not affect the basis of their strategic relations.\par \par \uc2 It's been over 20 years since the emergence of the North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  nuclear issue, and during this time both Beijing and Pyongyang have experienced the leaderships of three generations. While the Sino-North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  relationship has been affected by the issue, the friendship has also been tested.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, even if the performances did not work out and it makes people feel confused, the big picture of bilateral ties is clear, and we are willing to keep praying for this friendship to continue.\par \par \uc2 Document GLOTNE0020151214ebce0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20\b \uc2 Korean talks\b0\par\par\uc2 463 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 December 2015\par \uc2 The Peninsula\par \uc2 PINSUL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2015, The Peninsula, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.   \par \par \uc2 The failure of talks between North and \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  isn't surprising.\par \par \uc2 The failure of talks between South and North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  which were aimed at easing cross-border tensions between the two sides didn't come as a surprise. Two days of high level talks broke up yesterday, and sadly, no date was set for further discussions. The fact that the talks took place can itself be considered an achievement because the vice-minister-level meeting, with a mandate to address a broad but unspecified range of inter-Korean issues, were the first of their type for nearly two years. But such is the depth of animosity and mistrust between the two neighbours that any breakthrough is possible only if both sides are willing to climb down from their positions. North \b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  especially seems to be averse to any negotiated settlement. The communist country revels in jingoism and threats, and its military leaders have an interest in keeping the tensions on the borders alive.\par \par \uc2 According to the chief delegate of \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  , Hwang Boo-Gi, the North Korean intransigence over what issues could be discussed contributed to the failure of the talks in the jointly-run Kaesong industrial zone. \b \highlight22\uc2 Seoul\b0 \highlight\uc2  had proposed the continuation of the talks next week, but Pyongyang rejected that proposal too.\par \par \uc2 While no major breakthrough was expected, there was a hope that the talks could lead to some cooperation in some areas \u8211\'20\'13 like the resumption of stalled cooperation projects that have significant symbolic and financial value. There were areas of interest for either side. For example, the impoverished North wanted the South to resume lucrative tours to its scenic Mount Kumgang resort, which the South had suspended in 2008 after a tourist was shot dead by a North Korean guard. \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  was very interested in family reunions and wanted the North to agree to regular reunions for families separated by the Korean War. Hwang said the North Korean side had insisted on linking the two issues and making a resolution of the Mount Kumgang question a precondition for discussing the reunions. According to the South Korean representative, the talks got stalled as the North Korean side insisted on linking the two issues and making a resolution of the Mount Kumgang question a precondition for discussing the reunions. They insisted that the two sides reach an agreement on the resumption of the tours first,\u8221\'20\'1D Hwang said. Our side stressed that the humanitarian issue of separated families and the resumption of the tours to Mount Kumgang are different in nature and should not be bundled together,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 The world sincerely hopes both countries will continue talking. \b \highlight22\uc2 South \b0 \highlight\b \highlight22\uc2 Korea\b0 \highlight\uc2  is a democratic country and therefore must take the initiative to bring the communist rival to the negotiating table.\par \par \uc2 Document PINSUL0020151213ebcd00039\par }\par }}
